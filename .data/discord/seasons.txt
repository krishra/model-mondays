Would it be possible to have a reasoning model generate the process that 4o could follow?

Example: 
System: Respond with steps to complete the actions using tools
User Asks: Research dolphins in google.
Response:
Detailed steps 

4o: Uses detailed steps to call tools
coulthrust — 3/21/25, 1:42 PM
The  o1 and o3 reasoning models dont have system messages  vs chat completion models will that change

Sure - in the delivery of services on GenAI implementations to non-profits a few clear services have become apparent to me.  As I identify them (e.g. GenAI Portfolio and Business Case Development, GenAI Strategy etc.).  Using my experience to feed into a prompt I get about 50%+ of the material I need to deliver the services - a huge time saver.

Cohere's Rerank is a tool designed to enhance search quality by reordering search results based on their semantic relevance to a query. It works with keyword or vector search systems and doesn't require a complete overhaul of existing setups. Using Cohere's API, you can integrate Rerank into your system with minimal effort, improving search precision and user experience.

Just a quick overview of Cohere Reranker and Azure AI Search 

Cohere Reranker and Azure AI Search are both powerful tools for enhancing search systems, but they serve slightly different purposes:

Cohere Reranker:
Focuses on reordering search results based on semantic understanding of user queries and document content.
Excels in processing complex queries and large documents with a context window of 4,096 tokens.
Offers multilingual support for over 100 languages.
Can be integrated into existing search systems or Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines to improve the relevance of retrieved documents.

Azure AI Search:
Provides a comprehensive search solution with features like indexing, querying, and semantic search.
Supports integration with various data sources and offers scalability for enterprise applications.
Includes tools for customizing search experiences, such as filters, facets, and scoring profiles.

Cohere Reranker is particularly useful for refining search results after initial retrieval, while Azure AI Search offers a broader range of search capabilities, including indexing and querying. Together, they can complement each other to create a robust search system.

Cache-Augmented Generation (CAG) and Fine-Tuning are two distinct approaches for enhancing the performance of large language models (LLMs), each with its own strengths and ideal use cases:

Cache-Augmented Generation (CAG)
How it works: CAG involves preloading a knowledge base into the model's context window. This allows the model to generate responses based on the cached information without needing external retrieval.
Advantages:
Low latency: Since the knowledge is preloaded, responses are faster.
Consistency: Responses remain stable across queries as the same knowledge base is used.
No external calls: Ideal for environments where database access is restricted.
Use cases: Product manuals, predefined FAQ responses, and conversational AI with structured knowledge.

Fine-Tuning
How it works: Fine-tuning involves retraining an LLM on a specific dataset to adapt it for specialized tasks or domains.
Advantages:
High accuracy: Tailored for domain-specific tasks.
Customizable: Can be adapted to organizational needs.
Improved performance: Enhances the model's ability to handle specialized queries.
Use cases: Sentiment analysis, fraud detection, and domain-specific customer feedback analysis.

In summary, CAG is great for scenarios requiring rapid, consistent responses from a predefined knowledge base, while Fine-Tuning excels in tasks that demand domain-specific expertise and precision.
Nitya Narasimhan, PhD 🗽🇺🇸🇮🇳 — 4/11/25, 1:48 PM

Shivamm — 4/18/25, 1:52 PM
Does it needs to include any model or it works something similar to Copilot?
Nitya Narasimhan, PhD 🗽🇺🇸🇮🇳 — 4/18/25, 1:53 PM
^ @Rong Lu [MSFT]  do you see questions in chat?
Shivamm — 4/18/25, 1:53 PM
while using extension feature such as prompt builder
Rong Lu [MSFT] — 4/18/25, 1:55 PM
Copilot is an AI coding assistant and it comes with several default models. It's also adding the ability to bring your own models to work with copilot. AI Toolkit is for building your own AI applications (could be a coding assistant or a chatbot, etc). AITK provides a variety of models you can experiment with.
Shivamm — 4/18/25, 1:55 PM
Also is there - nvidia/llama-3.3-nemotron-super-49b-v1
Nitya Narasimhan, PhD 🗽🇺🇸🇮🇳 — 4/18/25, 1:56 PM
I really loved this filter option so I can select models that run on my current local hardware (CPU / GPU) - but also finding it a useful extension to install in Codespaces and use with dev containers.
Shivamm — 4/18/25, 1:56 PM
So do we need to use our API key or we can use directly ?
Tony_Stark — 4/18/25, 1:56 PM
Yeah, it seems llama2-unsensored has no limit
Rong Lu [MSFT] — 4/18/25, 1:56 PM
for 3rd party models, such as Sonnet or Gemini, you do need to bring your own API keys. for GitHub hosted models - it is free for anyone with a GH ID.
Shivamm — 4/18/25, 1:57 PM
For using prompt builder?
Rong Lu [MSFT] — 4/18/25, 1:57 PM
same for all the features.
Shivamm — 4/18/25, 1:59 PM
Great, thanks
Nitya Narasimhan, PhD 🗽🇺🇸🇮🇳 — 4/18/25, 1:59 PM
Q: does the side-by-side comparison allow us to see perf/cost comparisons?
Rong Lu [MSFT] — 4/18/25, 1:59 PM
we have nvidia llama 3.1 but not 3.3 currently
Nitya Narasimhan, PhD 🗽🇺🇸🇮🇳 — 4/18/25, 2:00 PM
I see token usage - but not ocmpletion time (in compare mode) 
Shivamm — 4/18/25, 2:00 PM
Yes already worked with llama 3.1 but I was testing to compare code generation - nvidia/llama-3.3-nemotron-super-49b-v1 vs gpt 4.1 mini
Rong Lu [MSFT] — 4/18/25, 2:01 PM
we don't have completion time info for GH hosted models.
Nitya Narasimhan, PhD 🗽🇺🇸🇮🇳 — 4/18/25, 2:04 PM
Q: I know we have a number of MCP servers being created for Azure, GH, Playwright etc. - will AITK allow us to use MCP tools?
Shivamm — 4/18/25, 2:04 PM
On which basis/parameters does it generate dataset?
Rong Lu [MSFT] — 4/18/25, 2:05 PM
Yes! MCP server support is coming very soon.
Rong Lu [MSFT] — 4/18/25, 2:06 PM
data generation uses the model parameters and system prompt set in the model preferences side panel. as well as data in the current dataset as examples. 
Shivamm — 4/18/25, 2:07 PM
Perfect!!
Nitya Narasimhan, PhD 🗽🇺🇸🇮🇳 — 4/18/25, 2:07 PM
Q: Can we take eval outputs from local dev usage and have that pushed to Azure to take advantage of storage/viz tools there (and track history)?
Organicastudio — 4/18/25, 2:08 PM
Great information and learnings, thanks
Nitya Narasimhan, PhD 🗽🇺🇸🇮🇳 — 4/18/25, 2:08 PM
(Also love that we can open the results in Data Wrangler)
Rong Lu [MSFT] — 4/18/25, 2:08 PM
We will get there. that's the goal! we will build connections between the AI toolkit and the new Azure AI Foundry extension for VS Code to make the local to cloud transition smooth
Rong Lu [MSFT] — 4/18/25, 2:08 PM
yes more integration with Data Wrangler coming up soon! so much to do 🙂

me
perfectstorm — 6/20/25, 1:42 PM
to give additional context -- i was considering to fine-tune a model with proprietary code samples & looking to find a good base model to start with. currently thinking to use phi-4.
Lee Stott [Microsoft] — 6/20/25, 1:42 PM
GitHub Copilot Agent Mode supports a growing list of top-tier models, giving developers flexibility based on their preferences and project needs. As of now, you can access models like:
Claude 3.5 and 3.7 (via Anthropic)
GPT-4.5 and GPT-4o (via OpenAI or Azure OpenAI)
Gemini 1.5 (via Google)
Custom or local models through integrations like OpenRouter, Ollama, or other third-party APIs

Q: can you discuss knowledge graphs with RAG to reduce hallucinations with reasoning model 
Nitya Narasimhan, PhD 🗽🇺🇸🇮🇳 — 6/20/25, 1:56 PM
My favorite use case is visual reasoning right now - there is an example in the lab - but it was able to take a word puzzle from a screenshot and figure it out - and then make more. Think of it analyzing endgames for chess given a midgame snapshot
HM — 6/20/25, 1:56 PM
Yes, it’s a high need that communication between User and Model needs to be standardized, just like MCP, A2A . There is a lot of information that’s needed At response level and needs to be parsed out .
takescake — 6/20/25, 1:57 PM

Introducing a new approach to graph-enabled RAG. LazyGraphRAG needs no prior summarization of source data, avoiding prohibitive up-front indexing costs. It’s inherently scalable in cost and quality across multiple methods and search mechanisms:

@Miskaone  interesting - what hallucination did you see?
So my $0.02 is that architecture matters - and if reasoning is used for planning but other agents exxecute you will do better

question that I have is that I have a RAG application, but I also want to create an Intent router for meta-data questions.  I started looking at MCP, but Foundry is there as well, and now Agentic Query Plan is also in that ballpark.

Flo — 6/27/25, 1:47 PM
Not sure if this is THE place to ask, but I have a question on VRAM requirements per model too. I've noticed that for example if using models in Windows , increasing memory via paging file would not, for example , allow you to run a model with higher requirements which led me to believe that the VRAM req's per model are hard set. thoughts? thanks. 🐱

Hi Guy ! 🙂
Dimable — 6/27/25, 1:52 PM
I've created a chat agent (SemanticKernel + custom plugin connecting MongoDb). Now I'd like to expose the Mongo capabilities via MCP server to make  available to another agent (created in MS copilot studio). Is it possible for copilot to use my MCP?
Lee Stott [Microsoft] — 6/27/25, 1:52 PM
What Is an Intent Router
It’s a modular layer—think of it like a mini-orchestrator—that matches a user’s intent (e.g. "find people", "get articles about AI", "fetch latest content") with the corresponding MCP method and payload structure.
coulthrust — 6/27/25, 1:53 PM
Sounds like the intent router is deciding which tool or function to call based on the user query
This mcp will have resources like databse 1 and database 2 and know which to call when or call both
Nick Brady (Microsoft) — 6/27/25, 1:54 PM
mcp also has prompts and sampling too
coulthrust — 6/27/25, 1:55 PM
Try building with two tools eg database 1 and database 2 with a description of each to see if the agent can understand the "intent"

Heyyy
Nitya Narasimhan, PhD 🗽🇺🇸🇮🇳 — 7/11/25, 1:39 PM
Ah - yes the Microsoft AutoGen framework is different but is integrated seamlessly with the Azure AI Foundry. That said - would love to hear what you want to do with AG2? Maybe we can help decide if the tooling in AI toolkit will help.

Question for the audience - is anyone using MCP servers? I know the toolkit has integrationa nd testing capability so wanted to get a sense of which servers and experiences were in focus

How do I get started?
Nitya Narasimhan, PhD 🗽🇺🇸🇮🇳 — 7/11/25, 1:52 PM
I will let Leo answer - but will also say that part of the new focus is on context engineering where you maybe need to see if the design of the app can be distributed to use models with smaller windows.

Is there a specific use case where you need a really large window @Vryheid Jobeer
Shivamm — 7/11/25, 1:52 PM
I did Learn MCP , Notion, & created some custom MCPs

Secondly for my personal project I did created some

I haven't scratched there yet, I'm abusing github copilot pro to the max but no Azure AI foundry models yet. I've used Azure vision/ocr and Azure Speech because of the generous free tier API calls
Nitya Narasimhan, PhD 🗽🇺🇸🇮🇳 — 7/11/25, 2:02 PM
You can bring your own model to GitHub copilot as well - but absolutely see this as a way to explore things. Also definitely check out GitHub Marketplace models - it is a free (rate-limited) way to explore the same models in the Azure AI Foundry catalog - so if you are prototyping .. this is a good way to go
