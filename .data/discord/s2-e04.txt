(Leo) Not really Autogen but we use some tech behind the scenes - see https://aka.ms/aitoolkit for more on what Leo is talking about 
AI Toolkit for Visual Studio Code - Visual Studio Marketplace
Extension for Visual Studio Code - AI Toolkit for VS Code streamlines generative AI app development by integrating tools and models. Browse and download public and custom models; author, test and evaluate prompts; fine-tune; and use them in your applications.

Does the AI toolkit include some tools and if so what kind of tools?

I actually use the opensource version ag2 from Qingyun and Chi. So i am just trying to figure out how this works within that context.
i know its separate
Shivamm — 1:38 PM
Heyyy
Nitya Narasimhan, PhD 🗽🇺🇸🇮🇳 — 1:39 PM
Ah - yes the Microsoft AutoGen framework is different but is integrated seamlessly with the Azure AI Foundry. That said - would love to hear what you want to do with AG2? Maybe we can help decide if the tooling in AI toolkit will help.

The Agent Builder feature is a real time saver. You can learn about it here - but in reality I find it useful to help make my prompt design thinking better

Because Azure AI foundry is the best! 😛

Question for the audience - is anyone using MCP servers? I know the toolkit has integrationa nd testing capability so wanted to get a sense of which servers and experiences were in focus
Funmilayo🔥💜 — 1:51 PM
How do I get started?
Nitya Narasimhan, PhD 🗽🇺🇸🇮🇳 — 1:52 PM
I will let Leo answer - but will also say that part of the new focus is on context engineering where you maybe need to see if the design of the app can be distributed to use models with smaller windows.

Is there a specific use case where you need a really large window @Vryheid Jobeer
Shivamm — 1:52 PM
I did Learn MCP , Notion, & created some custom MCPs

Secondly for my personal project I did created some

Azure AI Foundry allows us to combine our data set with the model and work with it. Are there any methods in the AI ​​toolkit?

Ah interesting - what was the size of data you wanted to use as context? Good to know

hi, regarding the VS Code evaluator, is it possible to evaluate llm which also enhanced with RAG by connecting to a db instance

I haven't scratched there yet, I'm abusing github copilot pro to the max but no Azure AI foundry models yet. I've used Azure vision/ocr and Azure Speech because of the generous free tier API calls
Nitya Narasimhan, PhD 🗽🇺🇸🇮🇳 — 2:02 PM
You can bring your own model to GitHub copilot as well - but absolutely see this as a way to explore things. Also definitely check out GitHub Marketplace models - it is a free (rate-limited) way to explore the same models in the Azure AI Foundry catalog - so if you are prototyping .. this is a good way to go
Daniel D — 2:03 PM
Thank You.
