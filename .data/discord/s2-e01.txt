me
perfectstorm — 6/20/25, 1:42 PM
to give additional context -- i was considering to fine-tune a model with proprietary code samples & looking to find a good base model to start with. currently thinking to use phi-4.
Lee Stott [Microsoft] — 6/20/25, 1:42 PM
GitHub Copilot Agent Mode supports a growing list of top-tier models, giving developers flexibility based on their preferences and project needs. As of now, you can access models like:
Claude 3.5 and 3.7 (via Anthropic)
GPT-4.5 and GPT-4o (via OpenAI or Azure OpenAI)
Gemini 1.5 (via Google)
Custom or local models through integrations like OpenRouter, Ollama, or other third-party APIs

Absolutely! In fact, our public VoiceRAG demo itself uses function calling for Azure AI Search integ

Q: can you discuss knowledge graphs with RAG to reduce hallucinations with reasoning model 
Nitya Narasimhan, PhD 🗽🇺🇸🇮🇳 — 6/20/25, 1:56 PM
My favorite use case is visual reasoning right now - there is an example in the lab - but it was able to take a word puzzle from a screenshot and figure it out - and then make more. Think of it analyzing endgames for chess given a midgame snapshot
HM — 6/20/25, 1:56 PM
Yes, it’s a high need that communication between User and Model needs to be standardized, just like MCP, A2A . There is a lot of information that’s needed At response level and needs to be parsed out .

LazyGraphRAG sets a new standard for GraphRAG quality and cost
Introducing a new approach to graph-enabled RAG. LazyGraphRAG needs no prior summarization of source data, avoiding prohibitive up-front indexing costs. It’s inherently scalable in cost and quality across multiple methods and search mechanisms:

@Miskaone  interesting - what hallucination did you see?
So my $0.02 is that architecture matters - and if reasoning is used for planning but other agents exxecute you will do better
