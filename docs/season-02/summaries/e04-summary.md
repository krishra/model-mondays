# Model Mondays S2:E04 — AI Developer Experiences: AI Toolkit & Azure AI Foundry Extensions

## Abstract
**Title:** AI Developer Experiences: AI Toolkit & Azure AI Foundry Extensions  
**Speakers:** April Gittens (Host), Leo Yao (Microsoft PM), Chararma (Highlights)  
**Description:** This episode explores the latest advancements in AI developer tooling at Microsoft, focusing on the AI Toolkit and Azure AI Foundry extensions for Visual Studio Code. The session features a live demo, practical guidance for building and deploying AI agents, and highlights from Microsoft’s research and product teams.

## Highlights
- Microsoft’s new medical AI model and Project Aurora for atmospheric science were spotlighted as cutting-edge research.
- GitHub Copilot Agent and Azure S Agent are making developer and operations workflows more autonomous and efficient.
- Project Emily introduces an autonomous agent for machine learning engineering tasks, streamlining ML workflows.
- The AI Toolkit for VS Code now supports model catalog browsing, local and cloud deployment, and agent building with integrated tools.
- Live demo showed how to deploy models, build agents, connect to MCP servers, and generate code for programmatic use.

## Spotlight
The spotlight segment featured Leo Yao, Product Manager at Microsoft, who demonstrated the end-to-end workflow for building generative AI agents in Visual Studio Code using the AI Toolkit and Azure AI Foundry extensions. Leo walked through model catalog browsing, deploying models to Azure, and using the agent builder to create both local and cloud-based agents. The demo included connecting agents to Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers, configuring tools like Bing search and code interpreter, and generating code for further development. The session emphasized the flexibility of bringing your own models, integrating local or remote resources, and the ease of transitioning from visual design to code-first workflows. Leo also addressed audience questions about MCP server management, multi-model support, and code generation for programmatic agent deployment.

## Takeaways
- Microsoft’s AI Toolkit and Azure AI Foundry extensions streamline the process of building, deploying, and managing AI agents in VS Code.
- Developers can leverage a rich model catalog, deploy models locally or in the cloud, and integrate tools like MCP servers and Bing search.
- The extensions support both visual and code-first workflows, making them accessible to a wide range of developers.
- New research and product features, such as Project Emily and GitHub Copilot Agent, are pushing the boundaries of AI-driven productivity.
- Community engagement and feedback are encouraged to drive further improvements in these tools.
