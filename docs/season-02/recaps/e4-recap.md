## Key Takeaways

1. **Unified Development Experience**: AI Toolkit provides a seamless experience from model discovery to agent deployment, all within VS Code, eliminating the need to switch between multiple tools.

2. **Flexible Model Access**: Developers can choose between GitHub Models for free prototyping, local models for offline development, or Azure AI Foundry for production deployments.

3. **MCP Integration is Mature**: The toolkit supports both consuming existing MCP servers and creating custom ones, with comprehensive documentation and hands-on labs available.

4. **Evaluation is Built-in**: The platform includes comprehensive evaluation tools for measuring agent quality, with both built-in and custom evaluator support.

5. **Community-Driven Learning**: Regular series like "Agent Support" blog posts and video tutorials provide ongoing learning resources for developers at all levels.
