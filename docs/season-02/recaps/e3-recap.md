# Episode 3 Recap: SLMs and Reasoning

## Attendees
- Lee Stott [Microsoft]
- Mojan
- Nitya Narasimhan, PhD
- Community members from various regions

## Locations
- India (Kolkata, general)
- South Africa
- Sri Lanka
- Canada
- UK
- New York, USA

## Core Topics Discussed
- Phi-4 reasoning models and SLMs for agentic applications
- Using Phi-4 with Ollama and local hosting
- Model catalog and resources for SLMs
- Fine-tuning, quantized versions, and LORA for prompts
- Benchmarks for agentic tool use (BFCL)
- Foundry-Local and observability in Azure AI Foundry
- Use cases: code generation, optimization problems, transparency

## Key Takeaways
1. Phi-4 reasoning models are redefining SLMs for agentic and resource-constrained scenarios.
2. Community members are experimenting with local hosting and fine-tuning of SLMs.
3. Microsoft provides extensive resources, tutorials, and benchmarks for SLMs and agentic evaluation.
4. Observability and transparency are key for deploying and evaluating SLMs in production.
5. The Phi Cookbook and Foundry-Local are valuable resources for developers.
