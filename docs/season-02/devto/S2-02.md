## About Model Context Protocol (MCP)

MCP is a protocol that standardizes how AI applications connect the underlying AI models to required knowledge sources (data) and interaction APIs (functions) for more effective task execution. Because these models are pre-trained, they lack access to real-time or proprietary data sources (for knowledge) and real-world environments (for interaction). MCP allows them to "discover and use" relevant knowledge and action tools to _add relevant context_ to the model for task execution.

- Learn: [MCP For Beginners](https://aka.ms/mcp-for-beginners)
- Watch: Anthropic Workshop on MCP (below), AI Engineer Summit NY 2025

## Securing MCP

As MCP started gaining traction, the conversation turned to the topic of secure MCP usage, particularly in enterprise environments. How should MCP clients _authenticate_ with MCP servers, and get _authorization_ for access to the right resources? In early 2025, the conversation began on an MCP Authorization spec - here are the three documents that help you understand the issues & proposal process.

1. Aaron Parecki, [Let's Fix OAuth in MCP](https://aaronparecki.com/2025/04/03/15/oauth-for-model-context-protocol)
2. Den Delimarsky, [Improving The MCP Authorization Spec - One RFC At A Time](https://den.dev/blog/model-context-protocol-oauth-rfc/)
3. MCP Specification, [Authorization](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/draft/basic/authorization) protocol draft

On Monday, Den joined us live to talk about the work he did for the authorization protocol. **Watch the session now** to get a sense for what the MCP Authorization protocol does, how it works, and why it matters. Have questions? [Submit them to the forum](https://github.com/orgs/azure-ai-foundry/discussions/64) or [Jon the Foundry Friday AMA](https://discord.gg/azureaifoundry?event=1382860621137317948) on Jun 27 at 1:30pm ET.
