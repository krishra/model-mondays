### Event Details

How can you bring advanced reasoning to resource-constrained devices? This session explores the latest in Small Language Models (SLMs) like Phi-4, which are redefining what‚Äôs possible for agentic apps. Mojan Javaheripi will discuss how SLMs leverage inference-time scaling and chain-of-thought reasoning to deliver powerful results on smaller hardware. Discover use cases, deployment strategies, and how SLMs are making AI more accessible and efficient for everyone.
