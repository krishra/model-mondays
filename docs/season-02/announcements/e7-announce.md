### Event Details

Imagine if your AI app could automatically pick the best model for every task! This session explores Model Router, a deployable chat model that acts as a multi-model proxy, routing requests to the optimal model based on query complexity, cost, and performance. Learn how model auto-selection can streamline your workflows, save resources, and deliver high-quality results in real time.
