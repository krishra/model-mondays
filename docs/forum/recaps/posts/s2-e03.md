# Foundry Friday AMA · Jul 03, 2025 · SLMs & Reasoning (Phi-4 Reasoning)



⁉️ Have questions on the Phi-4 Reasoning model or the Phi-4 Reasoning-Plus model variant?
Add them here! We'll post a recap after the AMA on this thread 

This is part of the [#ModelMondays](https://aka.ms/model-mondays) project where we invite a subject matter expert to our Monday livestream to demo a key model or model-related technology - then have them do an AMA on Friday on the Azure AI Foundry Discord to take questions and have a more open-ended conversation.
