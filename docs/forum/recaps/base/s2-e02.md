**AMA On Model Context Protocol:**
This is part of the [#ModelMondays](https://aka.ms/model-mondays) project where we invite a subject matter expert to our Monday livestream to demo a key model or model-related technology - then have them do an AMA on Friday on the Azure AI Foundry Discord to take questions and have a more open-ended conversation. 

🌟🌟 See #54 **for the full Foundry Fridays AMA schedule** 🌟🌟
