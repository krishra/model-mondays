## What are Reasoning models?

Reasoning models are a new category of Large Language Models that are trained (with large-scale reinforcement learning) to think deeply before they respond. These reasoning abilities are achieved by a combination of techniques including chain-of-thought, self-consistency, and deliberative alignment.

Reasoning models are designed to tackle hard problems involving logic, stratgegy, complex reasoning and multi-step planning. They are particularly effective in STEM fields (math, science, coding) where they can outperform popular general-purpose models in competitive benchmarks. 

Want an introduction to reasoning models? Watch this episode from Season 1 where Jennifer Marsman covers the OpenAI o-series of reasoning models.

## Advanced Reasoning Scenario

While the previous talk gives you a sense for what reasoning models are with a real-world use case, this _advanced reasoning_ episode takes it a step further with an end-to-end sample and workshop that teaches you how to build a **Deep Researcher** - a research assistant that can conduct comprehensive web research, analyze & synthesize the information, and present its findings in a report.

The solution uses the DeepSeek-R1 reasoning model with the Tabily web search API, and the LangGraph framework to perform iterative cycles of research before delivering the final result. Watch the livestream of the episode below:
