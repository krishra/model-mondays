# S2:E4 Understanding AI Developer Experiences with Leo Yao

> Model Mondays is a weekly series to build your Azure AI Foundry Model IQ. In this episode, we focus on AI Developer Experiences — and learn how to streamline the AI developer journey from model selection and usage to evaluation and app deployment.

_This week in Model Mondays, we focus on AI Developer Experiences — and learn how we can streamline the AI developer journey from model selection and usage to evaluation and app deployment. Read on for my recap of Leo Yao's insights on the AI Toolkit and Azure AI Foundry extensions for Visual Studio Code and the key capabilities they provide for generative AI app & agent development._

### About Model Mondays

Model Mondays is a weekly series designed to help you build your Azure AI Foundry Model IQ step by step. Here's how it works:

- 5-Minute Highlights – Quick news and updates about Azure AI models and tools on Monday
- 15-Minute Spotlight – Deep dive into a key model, protocol, or feature on Monday
- 30-Minute AMA on Friday – Live Q&A with subject matter experts from Monday livestream

## Spotlight On: AI Developer Experiences

### 1. What is this topic and why is it important?

AI Developer Experiences focus on creating seamless, integrated workflows that take developers from ideation to production without friction. The AI Toolkit and Azure AI Foundry extensions for Visual Studio Code represent a new paradigm where AI development becomes as natural as traditional coding. Instead of juggling multiple tools, platforms, and interfaces, developers can now build, test, evaluate, and deploy AI applications all within their familiar VS Code environment.

This matters because the complexity of AI development has been a major barrier to adoption. By streamlining the developer experience, we're making AI development accessible to a broader range of developers, not just AI specialists.

### 2. What is one key takeaway from the episode?

The most important insight is that great AI developer experiences should feel invisible — they should enhance your natural workflow rather than force you to learn entirely new processes. The AI Toolkit demonstrates this by integrating model management, testing, and deployment directly into VS Code, allowing developers to stay in their flow state while building sophisticated AI applications.

### 3. How can I get started?

To get started with enhanced AI developer experiences:
1. Install the AI Toolkit extension for VS Code from the VS Code marketplace
2. Install the Azure AI Foundry extension for seamless cloud integration
3. Explore the built-in templates and samples for common AI application patterns
4. Use the integrated playgrounds to test and iterate on your models
5. Follow the step-by-step tutorials in the extension documentation

### 4. What's new in Azure AI Foundry?

## My A-Ha Moment

What really struck me during this episode was realizing how much time I've been wasting switching between different tools and interfaces when building AI applications. I used to think that complexity was just part of AI development — that I needed to use the web portal for model management, a different tool for testing, another for evaluation, and yet another for deployment.

But seeing Leo demonstrate the integrated workflow in VS Code made me realize that the best developer experiences should reduce cognitive load, not increase it. When everything works together seamlessly, I can focus on solving the actual problem rather than managing tools. It's like the difference between cooking in a well-organized kitchen versus constantly searching for utensils in different rooms!

## Coming up Next Week

Next week, we dive into Fine Tuning & Distillation with Dave Voutila. We'll explore how model customization is critical to ensuring the model is optimized for your application requirements, including fine-tuning Azure OpenAI models, using distillation techniques for efficient knowledge transfer, and other best practices in Azure AI Foundry.
