# Model Mondays S2E8: On-Device & Local AI 

Welcome to Episode 8! This week, we explored how AI is moving from the cloud to your own device, making it faster, more private, and more accessible. We also saw a real-world customer story from [Xander Glasses](https://www.xanderglasses.com/xanderglasses), showing how AI can help people with hearing loss by providing sight for sound.

## 1. Weekly Highlights

_The episode kicks off with new highlights covering the top 5 news items from the past week_.

## 2. Spotlight On: Foundry Local with Maanav Dalal

_This episode put the spotlight on local and on-device AI by looking the Foundry Local product from Core AI. Watch the video to see a live demo of the capabilities from Core AI Product Manager, Maanav Dalal_.

- **What is Foundry Local?** - A toolkit to run open-source AI models directly on your device (CPU, GPU, NPU) for fast, private, and efficient inference.
- **Why does it matter?** -  Developers can work with data locally, switch seamlessly between local and cloud, and leverage rich tooling (CLI, SDK, REST API).
- **Demo Highlights:**  
  - Install Foundry Local ([GitHub Repo](https://github.com/microsoft/foundry-local))
  - List and run models on device
  - Use RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) with local documents
  - Monitor deployments and cache models
  - Integrate with VS Code and GitHub Copilot ([AI Toolkit for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-ai-foundry.ai-toolkit))

## 3. Customer Story: Xander Glasses

_Customer Stories puts the focus on Azure AI usage in the real world. In this episode we talk to the team behind Xander Glasses, a wearable assistive device that brings sight to sound with real-time captioning_.

- **Problem:** - Real-time captioning for people with hearing loss, especially in noisy environments or where Wi-Fi/cloud is unreliable.
- **Solution:** -  Smart glasses with embedded Microsoft Speech SDK ([Speech SDK](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/speech-service/)), running speech-to-text locally for instant captions.
- **Innovation:**  - Using generative AI to simplify captions for users with cognitive disabilities, and supporting multiple languages and translation features.
- Learn more about the device experience: [XanderGlasses](https://www.xanderglasses.com/xanderglasses)


## 4. Key Takeaways

_Here are the key learnings I had from this episode_.

1. **On-Device AI Inference is Here** -[Foundry Local](https://github.com/microsoft/foundry-local) lets you run powerful models on your own hardware, unlocking speed and privacy benefits for flexibility.
2. **Seamless Integration With Existing Workflows** - Foundry Local provides an intuitive [CLI, SDK, and REST API](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-foundry/foundry-local/), with easy scaling from local development to Azure AI Foundry (cloud) as needed.
3. **Real-World Azure AI Impact -** [Xander Glasses](https://www.xander.tech/) show how AI can make a difference for accessibility, with instant, reliable captions using [Microsoft Speech SDK](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/speech-service/).
4. **Site Optimization For Agents:** Building APIs and semantic markup into your site makes it accessible to AI agents.

## Sharda's Tips: How I Wrote This Blog

Writing this blog felt like sharing my own learning journey with friends. I started by thinking about why this topic matters and how it could help someone new to Azure. I tried to explain things in a way that’s easy to understand, using simple language and real examples from the episode. To organize my thoughts and make sure I didn’t miss anything important, I used GitHub Copilot.

Here’s the prompt I gave Copilot to help me draft this blog:

> Generate a technical blog post for Model Mondays S2E8 based on the transcript and episode details. Focus on Foundry Local, Xander Glasses, and real-world demos. Explain the concept for students, add a section on practical applications, and share tips for writing technical blogs. Make it clear, engaging, and useful for developers and students.

After watching the video, I felt inspired to try out these tools myself. The way the speakers explained and demonstrated everything made me believe that anyone can get started, no matter their background. My goal with this blog is to help you feel the same way—curious, confident, and ready to explore what AI and Azure can do for you. If you have questions or want to share your own experience, I’d love to hear from you.
