## Spotlight On: Fine Tuning & Distillation

### 1. What is this topic and why is it important?

Fine tuning and distillation are advanced model customization techniques that allow you to create models perfectly suited to your specific use cases. Fine tuning involves training a pre-trained model on your specific data to improve its performance on your particular tasks. Distillation, on the other hand, transfers knowledge from a larger "teacher" model to a smaller "student" model, creating efficient models that retain much of the original's capabilities while being faster and more cost-effective.

These techniques are crucial because off-the-shelf models, while powerful, may not perform optimally for your specific domain, use case, or performance requirements. Customization ensures your model speaks your business language and delivers the precision your applications demand.

### 2. What is one key takeaway from the episode?

The key insight is that model customization is not just about making models perform better — it's about making them perform better for your specific needs while being practical to deploy. Through fine tuning, you can achieve specialized performance, and through distillation, you can make that performance accessible at scale with lower costs and faster inference times.

### 3. How can I get started?

To get started with fine tuning and distillation:
1. Identify your specific use case and gather high-quality training data
2. Explore the fine tuning capabilities in Azure AI Foundry for Azure OpenAI models
3. Start with small experiments to understand the impact of different approaches
4. Use Azure AI Foundry's evaluation tools to measure improvement
5. Consider distillation for production deployment to optimize cost and performance

### 4. What's new in Azure AI Foundry?

## My A-Ha Moment

The biggest lightbulb moment for me was understanding that fine tuning and distillation are not just advanced techniques for AI researchers — they're practical tools that can solve real business problems. I used to think that customizing models was too complex and expensive for most applications.

But Dave's explanation showed me that with Azure AI Foundry, these techniques are becoming accessible to regular developers. It's like having a tailor for your AI models — you can take something that fits okay and make it fit perfectly for your specific needs. And with distillation, you can then create a more efficient version that doesn't compromise on quality but is much more practical for production use.

The realization that I can create models that truly understand my domain and speak my business language, rather than just using generic models, opens up so many possibilities for more effective AI applications.

## Coming up Next Week

Next week, we dive into Research & Innovation with SeokJin Han and Saumil Shrivastava. We'll explore Azure AI Foundry Labs as a hub to explore cutting-edge research from Microsoft, including two key projects — the MCP Server for Azure AI Foundry, and the Magentic-UI for advancing research on human-in-the-loop experiences with AI.
