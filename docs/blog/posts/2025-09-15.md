# S2:E13 Understanding Open Source Models

> Model Mondays is a weekly series to build your Azure AI Foundry Model IQ. In this episode, we focus on Open Source Models — and learn about the Hugging Face collection on Azure AI Foundry Models with over 10K options.

_This week in Model Mondays, we focus on Open Source Models — and learn about the vast Hugging Face collection on Azure AI Foundry Models, which currently has over 10K options. Read on for my recap on when to use them, how to select the right one, and how to get started with Hugging Face models on Azure AI — plus how you can request new additions._

## Spotlight On: Open Source Models

### 1. What is this topic and why is it important?

Open Source Models, particularly the extensive Hugging Face collection available through Azure AI Foundry, represent a democratized approach to AI development where thousands of pre-trained models are freely available for developers to use, modify, and build upon. With over 10K options in the collection, developers can find specialized models for specific tasks, languages, or domains without starting from scratch.

This is important because it dramatically lowers the barrier to entry for AI development, enables experimentation with cutting-edge research, and provides alternatives to commercial models. Open source models also offer transparency, customizability, and the ability to run locally or in controlled environments.

### 2. What is one key takeaway from the episode?

The key insight is that the abundance of open source models transforms AI development from a question of "can we build this?" to "which model should we choose?" With over 10K options, the challenge becomes understanding model capabilities, licensing, performance characteristics, and selecting the right model for your specific use case and requirements.

### 3. How can I get started?

To get started with Open Source Models:
1. Explore the Hugging Face collection in Azure AI Foundry Model Catalog
2. Filter models by task type, language, or domain to narrow your options
3. Read model cards and documentation to understand capabilities and limitations
4. Test models in Azure AI Foundry playgrounds before implementation
5. Consider factors like model size, inference speed, and licensing for production use

### 4. What's new in Azure AI Foundry?

## My A-Ha Moment

My biggest realization was understanding the sheer scale and diversity of the open source AI ecosystem. I used to think that I needed to choose between a few major commercial models, but seeing the 10K+ options in the Hugging Face collection completely changed my perspective on what's possible.

What really struck me was learning that many of these open source models are highly specialized and can outperform general-purpose models on specific tasks. Instead of using a one-size-fits-all approach, I can now choose models that are specifically designed for my exact use case — whether that's code generation, multilingual translation, scientific text analysis, or any number of specialized domains.

The integration with Azure AI Foundry makes it incredibly easy to discover, test, and deploy these models. I don't have to worry about the infrastructure or compatibility issues that might come with using models from different sources. It's like having access to a vast library of specialized AI tools, all ready to use in a consistent environment.

## Looking Back at Season 2

As we wrap up Season 2 of Model Mondays, it's been an incredible journey exploring the breadth and depth of Azure AI Foundry capabilities. From advanced reasoning with SLMs to observability and open source models, we've covered the essential building blocks for modern AI development.

Each episode has shown how AI development is becoming more accessible, more powerful, and more practical for real-world applications. Whether you're just starting your AI journey or looking to expand your expertise, the tools and techniques we've explored provide a solid foundation for building the next generation of AI applications.
