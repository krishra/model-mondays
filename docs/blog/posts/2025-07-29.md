### 1. What does AI Assisted Azure Development mean



### 2. What is one key takeaway from the episode?

The key takeaway is that Model Router brings intelligence and flexibility to model selection. It can save developers time, reduce errors, and optimize results by always picking the best model for the job. This means you can focus on building features, not worrying about which model to use for every scenario.

### 3. How can I get started?

- Visit [Azure AI Foundry Labs](https://ai.azure.com/labs) to explore Model Router and related projects.
- Check out the Model Router documentation and sample repos for quickstart guides.
- Try deploying Model Router in your own Azure workspace and experiment with routing different types of queries.
- Join the Discord community to ask questions and share your experiences.
