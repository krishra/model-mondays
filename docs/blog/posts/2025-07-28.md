# S2:E7 Understanding Model Auto-Selection

> Model Mondays is a weekly series to build your Azure AI Foundry Model IQ. In this episode, we focus on Model Auto-Selection — and learn how automatic model selection can be made based on factors like query complexity, cost & performance.

_This week in Model Mondays, we focus on Model Auto-Selection — and learn about what happens when your model selection is made for you automatically, based on factors like query complexity, cost & performance. Read on for my recap on Model Router — a deployable chat model that acts like a multi-model proxy, intelligently routing requests to the best available model in real time, based on a given prompt._

## Spotlight On: Model Auto-Selection

### 1. What is this topic and why is it important?

Model Auto-Selection through Model Router represents a paradigm shift from manual model selection to intelligent, automated routing based on real-time analysis of prompt complexity, cost considerations, and performance requirements. Instead of developers having to choose which model to use for each request, the Model Router analyzes the incoming prompt and automatically selects the most appropriate model from a pool of available options.

This is crucial because it removes the burden of model selection from developers while optimizing for both cost and performance. Simple queries can be routed to faster, cheaper models, while complex reasoning tasks are automatically sent to more powerful models, ensuring the best balance of efficiency and capability.

### 2. What is one key takeaway from the episode?

The key insight is that intelligent model routing can dramatically improve both the user experience and cost efficiency of AI applications. By automatically matching the complexity of the task to the capability of the model, applications can deliver fast responses for simple queries while reserving expensive, powerful models for tasks that truly need them.

### 3. How can I get started?

To get started with Model Auto-Selection:
1. Explore the Model Router capabilities in Azure AI Foundry
2. Configure multiple models in your model pool with different cost and performance characteristics
3. Set up routing rules based on prompt complexity, keywords, or other criteria
4. Test different routing strategies and measure their impact on cost and performance
5. Implement fallback mechanisms for handling edge cases

### 4. What's new in Azure AI Foundry?

## My A-Ha Moment

The biggest revelation for me was realizing how much mental overhead I've been carrying by constantly having to decide which model to use for different tasks. I used to spend time analyzing each request, thinking about whether it needed GPT-4 for complex reasoning or if GPT-3.5 would suffice, worrying about costs, and sometimes making the wrong choice.

The Model Router concept completely flipped my thinking. Instead of me being the router, the system becomes intelligent enough to make these decisions automatically and probably better than I could manually. It's like having an expert AI consultant who instantly knows the best model for each situation.

What really struck me is that this isn't just about convenience — it's about unlocking capabilities I wouldn't have considered before. With automatic routing, I can design applications that seamlessly scale from simple interactions to complex reasoning tasks without having to architect different pathways for each complexity level.

## Coming up Next Week

Next week, we dive into On-Device & Local AI with Maanav Dalal. We'll explore how on-device inference is critical if you want to run AI models locally, on your own hardware, for edge computing needs. We'll learn about Foundry Local — a solution built on ONNX Runtime (for use in CPUs, NPUs & GPUs) that takes you from prototype to production.
