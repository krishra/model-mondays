# S2:E9 Understanding Models for AI Agents with Mona Whalin

> Model Mondays is a weekly series to build your Azure AI Foundry Model IQ. In this episode, we focus on Models for AI Agents — and learn how to build agentic AI applications with resources for configuration and design patterns.

_This week in Model Mondays, we focus on Models for AI Agents — and learn how to build agentic AI applications but with resources to learn configuration and design patterns. Read on for my recap of Mona Whalin's insights on the Azure AI Foundry Agent Catalog — open-source samples you can explore to accelerate your agent development by integration into projects!_

## Spotlight On: Models for AI Agents

### 1. What is this topic and why is it important?

Models for AI Agents focuses on the specific requirements and patterns needed to build effective agentic AI applications. Unlike traditional AI applications that respond to single queries, AI agents can perform multi-step reasoning, use tools, maintain memory across interactions, and execute complex workflows autonomously. The Azure AI Foundry Agent Catalog provides curated, open-source samples that demonstrate proven design patterns and configurations for building robust agents.

This is important because agentic AI represents the next evolution of AI applications — moving from simple question-answering to autonomous task execution. Having proven patterns and samples accelerates development and helps avoid common pitfalls in agent design.

### 2. What is one key takeaway from the episode?

The key insight is that successful AI agents require more than just powerful models — they need carefully designed architectures that handle memory, tool usage, error recovery, and multi-step reasoning. The Agent Catalog provides battle-tested patterns that address these challenges, allowing developers to focus on their specific use cases rather than reinventing foundational agent capabilities.

### 3. How can I get started?

To get started with Models for AI Agents:
1. Explore the Azure AI Foundry Agent Catalog for relevant patterns
2. Choose a sample agent that matches your use case and study its architecture
3. Understand the key components: memory management, tool integration, and reasoning loops
4. Start with a simple agent and gradually add complexity
5. Test thoroughly with edge cases and error scenarios

### 4. What's new in Azure AI Foundry?

## My A-Ha Moment

My biggest breakthrough was realizing that building AI agents is fundamentally different from building traditional AI applications. I used to think that making an AI agent was just about chaining together multiple AI calls, but Mona's presentation showed me it's much more sophisticated than that.

The real "aha" moment came when I understood that agents need to be designed like autonomous systems that can handle uncertainty, recover from failures, and maintain context across complex multi-step tasks. It's not just about the model being smart — it's about creating a system that can reason about its own actions and adapt to changing situations.

The Agent Catalog was a revelation because it showed me proven architectures for things I hadn't even considered: How does an agent decide when to use a tool? How does it maintain memory across long conversations? How does it handle conflicting information? These samples provide concrete answers to these design challenges.

## Coming up Next Week

Next week, we dive into Image & Video Playgrounds with Thasmika Gokal. We'll explore high-fidelity testbeds to prototype visual and video-based generative AI apps with cutting-edge models like Sora and GPT-image-1. Learn how to go from prompt to playback with Azure AI Foundry Image & Video Playgrounds. [Register Here!](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/reactor/events/26129/)
