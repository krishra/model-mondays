## Spotlight On: Model Context Protocol

This week, the Model Monday’s spotlight was on the Model Context Protocol (MCP) with subject matter expert Den Delimarsky. Don't forget to  [check out the slides from the presentation](https://speakerdeck.com/nitya/model-mondays-s2e02-model-context-protocol), for resource links!

**In this blog post, I’ll talk about my five key takeaways from this episode:**

- What Is MCP and Why Does It Matter?
- What Is MCP Authorization and Why Is It Important?
- How Can I Get Started with MCP?
- Spotlight: My Aha Moment
- Highlights: What’s New in Azure AI

## 1. What Is MCP and Why is it Important?

MCP is a protocol that standardizes how AI applications connect the underlying AI models to required knowledge sources (data) and interaction APIs (functions) for more effective task execution. Because these models are pre-trained, they lack access to real-time or proprietary data sources (for knowledge) and real-world environments (for interaction). MCP allows them to "discover and use" relevant knowledge and action tools to add relevant context to the model for task execution.

Want to learn more about MCP - check out the AI Engineer World Fair 2025 "MCP and Keynotes" track. It kicks off with a keynote from Asha Sharma that gives you a broader vision for Azure AI Foundry. Then look for the talk from Harald Kirschner on MCP and VS Code.

## 2. What Is MCP Authorization and Why Does It Matter? 

MCP (Model Context Protocol) authorization is a system that helps developers manage who can access their apps, especially when they are hosted in the cloud. The goal is to simplify the process of securing these apps by using common tools like OAuth and identity providers (such as Google or GitHub), so developers don't have to be security experts.

**Key Takeaways:**

The new MCP proposal uses familiar identity providers to simplify the authorization process.
It allows developers to secure their apps without requiring deep knowledge of security.
The update ensures better security controls and prepares the system for future authentication methods.

On Monday, Den joined us live to talk about the work he did for the authorization protocol.

## 3. How Can I Get Started? 
If you want to start working with MCP, here’s how to do it easily:

1. Learn the Fundamentals: [Explore MCP For Beginners](https://aka.ms/mcp-for-beginners) 
2. Use an MCP Server: [Explore VSCode Agent Mode support](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/chat/mcp-servers) 
3. Use MCP with AI Agents: [Explore the Azure MCP Server](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/azure-mcp-server/overview) 


<br/>

## 4. What’s New in Azure AI Foundry? 

1. Managed Compute for Cohere Models: Faster, secure AI deployments with low latency.
2. Prompt Shields: New Azure security system to protect against prompt injection and unsafe content.
3. OpenAI o3 Pro Model: A fast, low-cost model similar to GPT-4 Turbo.
4. Codex Mini Model: A smaller, quicker model perfect for developer command-line tasks.
5. MCP Security Upgrades: Now easier to secure AI apps using familiar OAuth identity providers.

## 5. My Aha Moment

Before this session, I used to think that connecting apps to AI was complicated and risky. I believed developers had to build their own security systems from scratch, which sounded tough. But this week, I learned that MCP makes it simple. We can now use trusted logins like Google or GitHub and securely connect AI models to real-world apps without extra hassle.

**How I Learned This ?**

To be honest, I also used Copilot to help me understand and summarize this topic in simple words. I wanted to make sure I really understood it well enough to explain it to my friends and peers. I believe in learning with the tools we have, and AI is one of them. By using Copilot and combining it with what I learned from the Model Monday’s session, I was able to write this blog in a way that is easy to understand

**Takeaway for Beginners:**

It’s okay to use AI to learn what matters is that you grow, verify, and share the knowledge in your own way.


## Coming Up Next Week:
Next week, we dive into SLMs & Reasoning (Phi-4) with Mojan Javaheripi, PhD, Senior Researcher at Microsoft Research. This session will explore how Small Language Models (SLMs) can perform advanced reasoning tasks, and what makes models like Phi-4 reasoning efficient, scalable, and useful in practical AI applications.
