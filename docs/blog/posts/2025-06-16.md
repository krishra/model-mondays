# Topic: Advanced Reasoning

> Hello, I'm Sharda - a Gold Microsoft Learn Student Ambassador! You can learn more about me on my [GitHub Page](https://github.com/shardakaurr) and I will be your resident blogger for this season of Model Mondays! Each week, I hope to share my perspectives on what I saw and learned from the livestream and AMA sessions - and share resources that can help you skill up on that topic as well. Let's dive in.

## What Is a Reasoning Model?

Reasoning models are large language models (LLMs) trained with reinforcement learning techniques to "think" before they answer. Rather than simply generating a response based on probability, these models follow an internal thought process producing a chain of reasoning before responding.

They are optimized for complex problem-solving, decision-making, and context-driven answers that may involve planning, multi-hop reasoning, or external tool usage.

## 5 Key Takeaways from the Session

- What Is an Advanced Reasoning Scenario?
- How to Get Started with Reasoning Models  
- My Aha Moment
- Weekly Highlights ‚Äì What‚Äôs New in Azure AI

## 1. Why Are Reasoning Models Important?

In today's fast-evolving AI landscape, it's no longer enough for models to just complete text or summarize content. We need AI that can:

- Understand multi-step tasks  
- Make decisions based on logic  
- Plan sequences of actions or queries  
- Connect context across turns  

Reasoning models matter because they‚Äôre the foundation of building intelligent, context-aware agents. They enable next-gen AI workflows in everything from customer support to legal research and healthcare diagnostics.

**Reason:** They allow AI to go beyond surface-level response and deliver solutions that reflect understanding, not just language patterning.

## 2. What Is an Advanced Reasoning Scenario?

An advanced reasoning scenario is one where a model:

- Breaks a complex prompt into smaller steps  
- Retrieves relevant external data  
- Uses logic to connect dots  
- Outputs a structured, reasoned answer  

**Example:**  
A user asks: ‚ÄúWhat are the financial and operational risks of expanding a startup to Southeast Asia in 2025?‚Äù

A reasoning model might:
- Retrieve reports on Southeast Asia market conditions  
- Break down risks into financial, political, and operational buckets  
- Cross-reference data with recent trends  
- Return a reasoned, multi-part answer

## 3. How to Get Started with Reasoning Models

Here are simple steps to try reasoning models using Microsoft tools:

- **Explore the Azure AI Foundry**  
  Try DeepSeek R1, o4-mini, and other hosted models directly in Azure.

- **Use the SDKs and Labs**  
  Labs like [Lab 331](https://aka.ms/build/lab331) and [Lab 333](https://aka.ms/discuss/build25-lab333) help you build hands-on projects.

- **Try the Model Playground**  
  Compare different models on reasoning tasks and see which performs best.

- **Use GitHub Samples**  
  [Deep Research Agent using LangChain](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/deepresearch) is a great starting project.

## 4. My Aha Moment

Before this session, I thought reasoning meant longer or more detailed responses. But this session helped me realize that **reasoning means structured thinking** ‚Äî models now plan, retrieve, and respond with logic.

This inspired me to think about building AI agents that go beyond "chat" and actually assist users like a teammate. It also made me want to dive deeper into LangChain + Azure AI workflows to build mini-agents for real-world use.

## 5. Weekly Highlights ‚Äì What‚Äôs New in Azure AI

Here‚Äôs what‚Äôs new in the Azure AI Foundry:

- **Direct From Azure Models**  
  Try hosted models like OpenAI GPT on PTU plans

- **SORA Video Playground**  
  Generate video from prompts via SORA models

- **Grok 3 Models**  
  Now available for secure, scalable LLM experiences

- **DeepSeek R1-0528**  
  A reasoning-optimized, Microsoft-tuned open-source model

These are all available in the [Azure Model Catalog](https://ai.azure.com/explore/models) and can be tried with your Azure account.

## Did You Know? ‚Äì Model Router

**Model Router** is a deployable AI chat model that dynamically selects the best LLM based on your prompt. Instead of choosing one model manually, the Router makes that choice in real time.

**Why it‚Äôs powerful:**
- Saves cost by switching between models based on complexity  
- Optimizes performance  
- Lets you test and compare model outputs quickly  

Try it out in **Azure AI Foundry** or read more in the [Model Catalog](https://ai.azure.com/explore/models).

## Coming Up Next

Next week, we dive into **Model Context Protocol**, a foundation for multi-modal tools and agent workflows.
