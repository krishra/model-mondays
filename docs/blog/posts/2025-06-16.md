# Topic: Advanced Reasoning

> Hello, I'm Sharda - a Gold Microsoft Learn Student Ambassador! You can learn more about me on my [GitHub Page](https://github.com/shardakaurr) and I will be your resident blogger for this season of Model Mondays! Each week, I hope to share my perspectives on what I saw and learned from the livestream and AMA sessions - and share resources that can help you skill up on that topic as well. Let's dive in.

## What Is a Reasoning Model?

Reasoning models are large language models (LLMs) trained with reinforcement learning techniques to "think" before they answer. Rather than simply generating a response based on probability, these models follow an internal thought process producing a chain of reasoning before responding.

They are optimized for complex problem-solving, decision-making, and context-driven answers that may involve planning, multi-hop reasoning, or external tool usage.
